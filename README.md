TCP chat room build on python using socket programming

• We will be building a TCP Chat Room where clients could communicate over the network. Python provides 
two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the 
underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection oriented and connectionless protocols.

• Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, 
such as FTP, HTTP, and so on which would help us in implementing our idea.

• Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a 
process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.

• Also, Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, 
UDP, and so on. The socket library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a 
generic interface for handling the rest.

• We will be using the socket library to communicate between the process on different client machines.
